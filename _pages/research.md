My research sits at the applied end of Applied Mathematics and is most recently driven by questions in psycholinguistics and cognitive psychology.

### Understanding reading behaviour: eye-tracking and response times

Reading and comprehension of written text is often considered to be one of the hallmarks of human cognition. Yet, our understanding of human reading is still incomplete. My research is concerned with elucidating and quantifying processes in two key experimental paradigms: visual word recognition and eye-tracking. In the former, participants need to decide whether a string on a screen is a word or not, while in the latter, participants' eye movements are recorded while they read extended text on a screen. For both experimental settings, I am interested in how single participant behave, which means response times and accuracy in visual word recognition and fixation durations in eye-tracking. This requires moving beyond traditional statistical approaches and using modern techniques from distributional analysis and nonlinear time series.

### Language change in networks

Language change is ubiquitous, and it is primarily driven by the input that we encounter. A key source for this is the conversations that we have with e.g. family, friends and colleagues. Many of the changes that occur in language begin with teens and young adults. As young people interact with others their own age, their language grows to include words, phrases, and constructions that are different from those of the older generation. Some of these changes have a short life span (have you heard ‘groovy’ lately?), but others stick around to affect the language as a whole. Studying language change makes it apparent that language evolution is a network phenomenon.

In my group, we drive to understand how different network properties (topologies, connection strengths) and different processes affect language change. This work combines extensive agent-based simulations with statistical analyses of the resultant patterns. A prime goal is to unravel the mechanisms that underpin language change as observed in the real word, e.g. in a historic context. 

### Methods development

The interdisciplinary nature of my work often requires the development of new mathematical, computational and statistical tools or the adaptation of existing approaches. Over the years, this has resulted in novel approaches to solve three-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations with spatially localised sources using Green's functions (as exemplified by the dynamics of intracellular calcium), to analyse network synchrony of non-smooth oscillators using the Master Stability approach, to quantify emergent behaviour in excitable systems originating from stochastic thresholds and most recently to gauge the power (and drawbacks) of advanced statistical inference methodologies.
