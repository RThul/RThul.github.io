I am an Associate Professor in Applied Mathematics in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mathematics/index.aspx) at the [University of Nottingham](http://nottingham.ac.uk).

My research focusses on the development and analysis of mathematical, statistical and  computational models that address key questions in psycholinguistics and cognitive psychology as well as in cell biology. The interdisciplinary nature of my projects often requires techniques from multiple fields including nonlinear dynamical systems, stochastic processees, partial differential equations, statistical physics, network science and statistical inference based on linear mixed effects models and Markov Chain Monte Carlo.

My work has been supported by the Leverhulme Trust, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), the Wellcome Trust and the British Council.
